# I am currently developing a Cooperative Sci-Fi Colony Building Game with the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)!
## Planned Features
### Co-op multiplayer with up to 40 players per server
### Harsh planetary environment and unforgiving survival elements (eg. oxygen, physical & mental health, food, water, sleep)
### Collaborative base-building and common tasks (eg. mining, water production, hydroponic farming, medical rescue)
### Huge 8 x 8 km world giving rise to unique logistical needs (eg. ore transport via truck routes, medical rescue via space shuttle)

## My motivation
I am mainly programming this game for my father and me. We are both hardcore survival game enthusiasts who are desperately craving for a challenge. It is difficult to find such games since the gaming industry is catered to casual gamers. And we have already tried and enjoyed most of them anyway.

## Strong Focus on Performance
I will be honest with you here. I want this game to work smoothly on my 2015 laptop (Intel Core i7 and Nvidia GTX 970M). Many would consider my specs to be on the lower side, even "potato". But there you go, my PC is the guideline!
### Thus I have opted for low-poly graphics and simplified animations for example. And wherever I can cut back on unnecessary effects and fanciness, I do so. This game is not going to be a AAA game. But its ORIGINAL and UNIQUE concept will definitely be AAA.

## It's Going To Take Ages!
Let's face it, even with the strongest motivation, it doesn't change the fact that I'm working alone. So yes, development will take years and I wanted to make sure that you understand this.

## Currently Included Features:
### Terrain and mineable rocks
### Weather events
### Co-op multiplayer
### Server discovery
### Player animations

## Currently Working On:
### Player customization (torso decal)
### PayPal integration (for monthly subscription of around 3 euros)
### Github website
