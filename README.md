## Planned Features
* ### Co-op multiplayer with up to 40 players per server
* ### Harsh planetary environment and unforgiving survival elements
  * _(eg. oxygen, food, water, sleep, physical & mental health)_
* ### Collaborative base-building and tasks
  * _(eg. underground housing, space port, weather & communication towers, mining, water production, hydroponic farming, medical rescue)_
* ### Huge 8 x 8 km world giving rise to unique logistical needs
  * _(eg. ore transport via truck routes, medical rescue via space shuttle)_
* ### Space Port trade quotas in order to reach higher levels of colonial development
  * _(eg. bonuses and penalties imposed by the interplanetary trade authority)_
* ### Waves of alien invasion for which colonists will have to prepare thoroughly
  * _(eg. alien detection via player-built radar towers, defensive walls/weapons/vehicles)_

## Strong Focus on Performance
* I will be honest with you here. I want this game to work smoothly on my 2015 laptop (Intel Core i7 and Nvidia GTX 970M). Many would consider my specs to be on the lower side, even "potato". But there you go, **_my PC is the point of reference!_**
* Thus I have opted for **_low-poly graphics_** and **_simplified animations_** for example. And wherever I can cut back on unnecessary effects and fanciness, I do so. This game is not going to be an AAA game. But its **_ORIGINAL_** and **_UNIQUE_** concept will definitely be AAA.

## Motivation
* I am mainly programming this game for my father and me. We are both hardcore survival game enthusiasts who are desperately craving for a challenge. It is difficult to find such games since the gaming industry is catered to casual gamers. And we have already tried and enjoyed most of them anyway.

## It's Going To Take Ages!
* Let's face it, even with the strongest motivation, it doesn't change the fact that I'm working alone. So yes, **_development will take years_** and I want to make sure that you understand this.

## Currently Included Features:
* Terrain and mineable rocks
* Weather events
* Co-op multiplayer
* Server discovery
* Player animations

## Currently Working On:
* Player customization (torso decal)
* PayPal integration (for monthly subscription of around 3 euros)
* Github website

## My Other Projects
* [Kanji Rakuen](https://www.kanji-rakuen.org/) for advanced learners of Japanese
* [AI少女](https://www.tugikuru.jp/novel/content?id=52010) Sci-Fi novel published in Japan
